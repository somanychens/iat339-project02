				<h2>Moss Day</h2>
				<p>“REALLY?” WAS MORE OR LESS Jake Rodkin’s reaction when Olly Moss said yes. Yes, Olly Moss had said, he was interested in being part of this indie video game company that Jake and his colleague Sean were thinking about.
Yes, Olly said again: I’m interested. And, then, okay — that was that.</p>
				<p>That Campo Santo would launch with Olly Moss on board was a surprise for a handful of reasons. The British artist and graphic designer, 27, is a major and sought-after talent, known for his work with clients like Mondo, DC Comics, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, Studio Ghibli and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He is not known for making video games. Nor is he really known for working in the way that a project like Campo Santo’s Firewatch needs to be worked on: as a member of a team, serving a shared creative vision, and on a timeline of many months, if not years.</p>
