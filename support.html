				<h3>System requirements</h3>
				<div class="content" id="faq-pc">
					<p><strong>Can my PC run the game?</strong></p>
					<p>The minimum requirements to run the game on a PC are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>OS: Windows 7 or higher 64bit</li>
						<li>Processor: Intel Core i3 2.00 GHz or AMD equivalent</li>
						<li>Memory: 6GB RAM</li>
						<li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 450 or higher with 1GB Memory</li>
						<li>Storage: 4GB available space</li>
						<li>DirectX: DX11</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="content" id="faq-32bit">
					<p><strong>What if I have a 32bit operating system?</strong></p>
					<p>32bit OS's are only able to utilize a maximum of ~3GB of system memory, and are unsupported at this time.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Known issues & fixes</h3>
				<div class="content" id="faq-stuck">
					<p><strong>I'm stuck and can't move my character!</strong></p>
					<p>We have implemented an "Unstuck" button in the Pause menu! It will teleport you to the nearest waypoint on the map.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content" id="faq-crash">
					<p><strong>The game keeps crashing!</strong></p>
					<p>There are a few common causes for this issue:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>You are running the game with out of date hardware or drivers that don't support full DX11 features on Windows 7, 8, or 10.</li>
						<li>You are attempting to run the game with less than 6GB of RAM.</li>
						<li>You are running the game with very little space (&lt;2GB) available on your OS hard drive (typically C: on Windows).</li>
						<li>Your anti-virus or similar program is for some reason protecting writing and reading from the game's save folders (on Windows this is in %APP_DATA% on your OS drive).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>You should ensure you have installed the latest graphics drivers for your computer.</p>
					<p>If you are still experiencing crashes, it may be helpful to send us your machine's specs and a log file that we can use to categorize your issue. Please attach this file to your support email when contacting us at <a href="">support@thegame.com</a> to speed up the process.</p>

				<div id="faq-2">
					<h3>I’ve got a problem with my copy of the game! Or my in-game photos!</h3>
					<p>Please visit our support website.

					If you're playing the Windows, Mac, or Linux version of the game, check out the Firewatch Steam forums because we might have already solved the problem.

					P.S. Video game development is very hard. We’ll try to solve your issue quickly and to the best of our abilities.<p>

					<h3>Who made this?</h3>
					<p>Firewatch was developed by Campo Santo, a new independent video game studio in San Francisco. This is Campo's first game, but its members have made some games you might have enjoyed, including Mark of the Ninja, Brutal Legend, The Cave, BioShock 2, and The Walking Dead: Season 1. Learn more about Campo at our company site.</p>

					<h3>Who was your publisher?</h3>
					<p>Firewatch was published as a joint venture by Campo Santo and Panic Inc., a Portland-based software company. This is the first major video game release from both companies, and you can read more about their relationship here and here.</p>

					<h3>I want to keep up with you guys!</h3>
					<p>Great! We've got an excellent dev blog and we're on Twitter and Facebook as well!

					We also, for some reason, publish a very entertaining quarterly newsletter and literary journal.</p>

					<h3>You didn't answer my question!</h3>
					<p>Come talk to us on Twitter! If you're having a technical problem, head to our support site or post on the Firewatch Steam forums!</p>
